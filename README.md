# Trip Manager
TripManager is a platform designed to help travelers plan and organize their trips. It uses a combination of review, rating, and social media comments to recommend destinations and attractions to users. Additionally, it provides a map to show the location of these recommended places.

TripManager does not recommend specific hotels or adventure activities. Instead, it provides information on popular destinations and attractions in a given location, along with reviews and ratings from other travelers. This allows users to make informed decisions about where they want to stay and what activities they want to do based on the experiences of others.But we can add this feature in future.

By using social media comments and reviews, TripManager is able to provide a more personalized experience for users, as it takes into account the opinions and preferences of other travelers. The platform also provides a map to help users visualize the location of each recommended destination and attraction, making it easier to plan their trip and navigate to each location.

Overall, TripManager is a useful tool for travelers who want to plan their trips based on the experiences of others and find popular destinations and attractions in a given location.
